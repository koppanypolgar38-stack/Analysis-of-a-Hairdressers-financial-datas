# Analysis-of-a-Hairdressers-financial-datas
In this code I tried to make analise a hairdresser's income, and cash-flow. The main focus was on to find as much correlation as I can between datas.   
First there are the datas in some lists at the beginning of the code. I choose this solution, because I got the datas manually on papers.
I create some functions to count the correlation, and by using this the correlation coefficent.
The main_func is dedicated to find the median of the given datas. I had to be careful, because sometimes the list of the datas contains even number of datas.
Finally I created the charts, by using matblotlyb.
